# Disney Characters

It is a page in which given a list of characters, collected from an api, the list is shown to the user. 

In the first part of the page we see a search form in which we can search for a specific character by name. 

Below the search bar we have the option to click on each of the characters we like and these will be added to a list of favourites, which will be visible on the page so that we can delete a character or the complete list of favourites. 

Thanks to LocalStorage, we can view our favourite characters even if we close the page and open it again.

## Why this project even exist?
It comes from an Adalab exercise of module 2, in which they evaluate my knowledge acquired in this second module of JavaScript.
